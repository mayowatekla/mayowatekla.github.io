  <h2> What is climate change?</h2>
      
      <p> The change in the average conditions on Earth over time is known as climate change. While this is a natural process, human activity has sped up this process. The use of fossil fuels is one of the biggest reasons for this change as it contributes to greenhouse gases. </p>

  <h2> Why does it concern you?</h2>

      <p> No matter where you live in the world, you will be affected by climate change. Whether itâ€™s severe drought, forest fires or massive floods, climate change is a global issue. To combat the biggest threat to our lifestyle, we must work together.</p>
