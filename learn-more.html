<h2> Global Warming</h2>
    <p>You may have heard of greenhouses gases, but what does it mean? A greenhouse is used to protect plants inside from the cold outside. The Earth’s atmosphere does the same thing and it’s known as the greenhouse effect. Energy from the sun enters the atmosphere and warms the planets surface before being reflected towards space. However, the gases in the atmosphere prevent some of that heat from leaving, making the Earth warmer. Those gases are known as greenhouses gases. Most occur from the burning of fossil fuels. Some common ones are CO2 and CH4. </p>

<h2> Impact</h2>
    <p>The rising of sea levels may not seem like a problem right now however,  many of our beloved cities are expected to sink. For instance, Jakarta is projected to be entirely underwater by 2050 and Miami, Mumbai and New York will follow. Countries like the Netherlands, being very flat, will not survive the rising of sea levels.

<p>In 2021 8,619 forest fires occurred resulting in 2.6 million acres of land lost. Most of these were in California. These catastrophic fires are brought on by the increased  temperatures and drought making it easier for fires to burn.

<p>Climate change affects third world countries disproportionately as they do not have the same resources as first world countries to pursue sustainable development. Climate change pushes people further into poverty as it intensifies the effects of rapid urbanisation and population growth.
